    "productAbstract": "Abstract: This data product contains the quality-controlled laboratory metadata and minimally processed sequence data from NEON's soil microbial shotgun metagenomics sequencing. Typically, measurements are done on plot-level composite samples and represent up to three randomly selected sampling locations within a plot. For additional details, see the user guide, protocols, and science design listed in the Documentation section in this data product's details webpage. Queries for the basic data product package will return metadata tables that include laboratory methods and results from DNA extraction, sample preparation, and DNA sequencing for samples from the specified sites and within the specified date range. Queries for the expanded package will also include a table containing links to the raw sequence data files.\n\nLatency:\nThe expected time from data and/or sample collection in the field to data publication is as follows, for each of the data tables (in days) in the downloaded data package. See the Data Product User Guide for more information.\n\nmms_metagenomeDnaExtraction:  240\n\nmms_metagenomeSequencing:  240\n\nmms_rawDataFiles: 240",
    "productDesignDescription": "Three pre-determined, randomly assigned locations are selected for each sampling event within each of 10 plots distributed throughout a site; sampling locations within a plot are not re-sampled. Soil metagenomics sampling occurs annually during the historic peak in vegetation greenness. Soil samples are collected to a maximum depth of 30 cm, with organic and mineral soils sampled separately. Subsamples of homogenized soil (rocks, roots and organic debris removed) from each of the 3 sampling locations are combined to form a plot-level composite sample that is used for metagenomics analysis. Samples are frozen on dry ice and shipped to an analytical facility for DNA extraction, sample preparation and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Laboratory metadata are then delivered to NEON for QC testing and acceptance, and then are formatted for upload to public sequence repositories.",
    "productStudyDescription": "These data are collected at all NEON terrestrial sites.",
    "productBasicDescription": "The basic package includes basic sample information and sample identifiers for table merging and forming sequence data queries, as well as non-essential but potentially informative metadata, such as sample processing and analytical methods, equipment used, QA data and sampling personnel. Queries for the basic package will return data from mms_metagenomeDnaExtraction and mms_metagenomeSequencing for all dates within the specified date range. The mms_metagenomeDnaExtraction table is generic for all microbial genetic data products: non-target samples may be included and can be filtered using the field \"sequenceAnalysisType\" (filter to values of \"metagenomes\" and \"marker gene and metagenomes\").",
    "productExpandedDescription": "The expanded package includes metadata and links to the raw shotgun metagenomic sequencing data on a per sample basis. Queries for the expanded package will include data from mms_rawDataFiles for all dates and sites within the specified range. Typically there are two records for each dnaSampleID, one for each sequence read direction, although extremely large files may have been split into separate files, which would lead to multiple records per dnaSampleID.",
    "productSensor": "",
    "productRemarks": "Each record in `mms_metagenomeDnaExtraction` may have one child record in `mms_metagenomeSequencing`. A given `mms_metagenomeDnaExtraction.dnaSampleID` is expected to be sampled one time per collectDate (local time). Duplicate samples may exist where protocol and/or data entry aberrations have occurred; users should check data carefully for anomalies before joining tables.",
